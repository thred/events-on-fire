==================

The bind and unbind methods now support bindings to class objects. 
In case of bindings to a class object, the consumer is notified
on any event that was fired by a producer that is an instance of
the specified class (e.g. if a consumer is bonded to the Object.class
it will be notifies by any event it can handle).
