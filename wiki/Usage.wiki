# events-on-fire usage

[http://code.google.com/p/events-on-fire/wiki/Overview Back to Overview]

= Usage =

== Include the library ==

=== Include events-on-fire manually ===

Download the latest release: http://...

Add the jar manually.

=== Include events-on-fire via Maven ===

Add the following dependency:

{{{
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.code.events-on-fire</groupId>
  <artifactId>events-on-fire</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
}}}

== Basic example ==

You can use any object as event. Usually you create a class that holds all the stuff you need for handling the event, but it may be enough to use a String. 
 
=== Create a consumer (your listener) ===

Add a handleEvent method to you class:

{{{
public class MyClass {
  ...
  public void handleEvent(String event) {
    // handle the event
    ...
  }
  ...
}
}}}

=== Bind the consumer to a producer ===

{{{
Events.bind(producer, consumer);
}}}

The producer usually is your controller. In Swing this may be your Frame or a Component. In Web-Applications this may be the instance of a service. 

The consumer is the class with the handleEvent method. Keep in mind, that you have to handle the instance of the consumer. The references in the Events class are weak. If there is no reference left, the consumer will get cleaned up by the garbage collector.

=== Fire the event ===

{{{
Events.fire(producer, "some event");
}}}

Immediately all the event handlers of the consumers, which are bonded to the producer will get called. The consumer will only get called, if it has a event handler method that fits the event.
